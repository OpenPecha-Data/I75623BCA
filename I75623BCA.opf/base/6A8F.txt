In the language of India: Ārya Drāmiḍā Vidyārājā. In the language of Tibet: 'Phags pa 'gro lding ba'i rig sngags kyi rgyal po
Homage to all Buddhas and Bodhisatvas.
This I heard upon a time the Blessed One was staying in Śrāvastī at ???? At that time the Blessed One said to Venerable Ānanda:
Ānanda, remember this recollection which turns all lightning away, which has is held by the truly and completely awakened ones of the past as well as by myself.
Ānanda, in the eastern quarter there is lightning called ‘Radiant’ (‘od rather than ‘ong?). In the southern quarter, Ānanda, there is lightning called ‘Hundred moments/Languages. In the western quarter, Ānanda, there is lightning called ‘Fading light’. In the northern quarter, Ānanda, there is lightning called ‘Lord of the stream’.Ānanda, anyone who knows the names of these types of lightning and knows the regions in which they are found, know that for that person no danger whatsoever from lightning will occur. After writing down these names of the types of lightning, lightning will not fall on the place where one resides.
Next the Blessed One recites these phrases of the Drāmiḍa mantra:
Tadyathā: nimi ninimi ninimi ninimi na dhare | Bathing the three worlds in light, trident in hand, in this spot protect me from all lightning! Protect! Svāhā.
THE MANTRA SPOKEN BY ĀRYA AVALOKITEŚVARA Furthermore, at that time, Bodhisatva Mahāsatva Ārya Avalokiteśvara was seated, present in the aasembly. He said this to the Blessed One:
Blessed One, Here in this turn of the Dharma (dharmaparyāya), I will pronounce these phrases of the Drāmiḍa mantra:
Tadyathā | hate bihate nihate pratyarthike pratyamitre | śuddhe mukte bimale prabhāsvare aṇḍāre paṇḍare śvete paṇḍarabāsini | hari kara di | pi Drāviḍa mantragalālṣi dantimukhi | Protect us from from all untimely death! Protect! By the blazing radiance (tejas) of Ārya Avalokiteśvara, protect us from all untimely death! May [death] not be seen! Svāhā!
DHĀRAṆĪPADA OF GUHYAPATI VAJRAPĀṆI Next Guhyapati Vajrapāṇi pressed the palms of his raised hands together in homage towards the Blessed One, and said this to him:Blessed One, I, in the turn of the Dharma, pronounce the phrases of this dhāraṇi:
tadyathā | muni muni | muni muni | reri | mati mati | sumati | mahāmati | hā hā hā hā | You without evil – do not fear, by the pronouncemt of khyod Vajrapāṇi! Dṛḍḥā, svāhā!
Blessed One, anyone one who bears in their heart my protective formula, which is invincible by any other, or writes down the latters, I will protect from all dangers always and continuously. I will free them from any untimely forms of death!
THE DHĀRAṆĪMANTRAPADA OF BRAHMĀ SAHAMPATI Next, Brahmā Sahampati said to the Blessed One:Blessed One, I will pronounce these phrase of dhrāṇaṇī-mantra in connection with this dharmaparyāya, to give rise to benefit, goodness, and happiness for all beings (sarvasatvānām arthāya hitāya sukhāya):
tadyathā | hili mili cili svāhā | brahma svā re svā re svāhā | brahmagarbhapuṣpa saṃstare svāhā |
Blessed One, this is my protective formula called ‘Brahmadaṇḍa’, which fully prote ted against all untimely death and appease all evils.
DHARAṆĪPADA OF ŚAKRA DEVĀNĀMINDRA Then Śakra, Lord of the Gods, pressed the palms of his raised hands together in homage towards the Blessed One, and said this to him:Blessed One, I as well pronounce this dharaṇīpada in this dharmaparyāya:
tadyathā | nibaraṇī | bandha bandha | mā da na dhe | mati mati | tiṭi | go.o ri | gandhari | [[274b.6]] tsaṇḍali | mataṃgi | ba ra la ni | hīna-madhyama-dhāranī ma la ni | da la matte | tsakra-pakri | śapari śapari {{ better: śabari = śavari?}} svāhā |
Blessed One, sir, this is my spell (vidyā) named ‘Descent of Vajra tongues’{?}, which frees from all dangers and fully protects against all forms of untimely death.
THE DHARAṆĪMANTRAPADA OF THE FOUR GREAT KINGS After this, the Four Great Kings – Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Virūḍhaka, Virūpākṣa, and Vaiśravaṇa – pressed the palms of their raised hands together in homage towards the Blessed One, and said this to him:
Blessed One, for the healing of many people, for the happiness of many people, from compassion for the world, we as well pronounce this dharaṇī-mantra-pada for this dharmaparyāya:
tadyathā | puṣpe puṣpe | dharma ba ri ha ri {parihari?} | ārya-pra śa ste {ārya-praśaṣṭe?} | niramukte | maṃ gali | stute | ta bi te svāhā |
Blessed One, Sir, this is our protective formula of the Four Great Kings called ‘free of fear/danger’. If brings safety from all dangers, protects life, and fully protects from all forms of untimely death.
THE NĀGA KINGS Then the Nāga King Sāgara and the Nāga King Śataraśmi??? pressed the palms of their raised hands together in homage towards the Blessed One, and said this to him:
Blessed One, our great protective formula called ‘wish-fulfilling jewel’ turns away all lightning, drives away all forms of untimely death, counteracts all types of poisin, and when there is any threat from gshed byed, byad, zombies (vetāḍa), or inauspicious [events], Blessed One, we will issue forth from this Nāga realm, and, in order to cast off envy, we will meditate on compassion, and ???? For what reasons? Blessed One, we the nāgas have envious minds, and are driven by envy.
tadyathā | ardze | amare | amṛte | akṣaye | puṇyaparyābate | sarbapāpapraśamanāya svāhā | āryapuṇya so pa kī ye svāhā |
Blessed One, Sir: be informed that if a man or a woman recites the phrases of this mantra with their tongue, or writes it down in letters, they will not encounter any danger from lightning.
They will not die an untimely death from ‘root poison’, mche ba'i dug, dbyig dug, any other kind of poison ???. Be secure from all dangers, from all harm!
The Blessed One then said ‘it is well’ (sādhu) to Śakra, Brahmā, the World Guardians, the Lords of the Nāgas: Auspicious-faced ones (bhadramukha)! You are acting for the benefit of the many, for the happiness of the many (bahujana hitāya bahujana sukhāya): in order to retain/remember this dharmaparyāya the expostion of the phrases of the Drāṃidāmantra is good, it is good. In all place one will be protectin from gnyid log pa myos pa and rab tu myos pa.
When the Blessed One had said this, the monks, Śakra, Brahmā, the World Guardians, and the Nāga Lords, as well the world with its gods, humans, asuras, and gandharvas, were delighted, and praise the Blessed One’s teaching highly.
